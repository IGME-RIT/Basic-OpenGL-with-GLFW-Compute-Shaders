# Basic OpenGL with GLFW: Compute Shaders

Compute shaders can be used to perform parallel operations on large buffers of data.
This demo uses a compute shader to rotate a set of vertices around the origin in real time.

# Setup

You will need to have CMake installed on your computer, and properly added to your path.
